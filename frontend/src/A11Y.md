1) **Alternative Text for Images** - Have Provided descriptive and meaningful alternative text for images. This helps users with visual impairments understand the content of images through screen readers e.g adding the **alt** attrribute in my image tags 

2) **Accessible Form** - Created forms that are easy to understand and navigate, with proper labels, error messages, and instructions

3) **Focus Management** - its easy to navigate through interactive elements using the keyboard, and there should be a clear visual indication of the focused element 

4) **Semantic HTML** - used HTML tags and attributes to convey the structure and meaning of content is crucial. Semantic HTML helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand and present content appropriately.

5) **Keyboard Accessibility** - I have ensured that most functionality can be operated with a keyboard alone. Users who cannot use a mouse or other pointing device rely on keyboard navigation
